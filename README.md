## purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide a way to log & track bouldering problems I've worked on.

## initial thoughts / design 

(1) Add Route
  - allows me to add the following information: 
    - grade: enumerable (v0- thru v6+)
    - date_started
    - date_completed
    - completed: boolean
    - type: onsite, flash, project 
    - tags: list of strings (ex. crimpy, juggy, dynamic, reachy, slopers, pinchy, slab, overhung, balancey)

(2) Some sort of route / progress visualizer
